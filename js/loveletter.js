Cheers My love for our Two months.

It may sound like such a short time to the world, but to me, it holds a million memories, emotions, and reasons why Iâ€™ve fallen so deeply in love with you.ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—

From the moment we met, you brought light into places of my heart I didnâ€™t even know were dark. You made me feel seen, understood, and loved in a way that no one else ever has. And in these past two months, youâ€™ve become so much more than just someone I love youâ€™ve become my home, my peace, my safe place.ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—

I love you for all that you are, I love your voice, your good morning and goodnight messages, your moods, your deep thoughts, and your dreams. I love how you care so deeply, how you love so gently yet fiercely. I love the way your voice calms me, how your laugh lights something up in me, how your presence makes even the quietest moments feel like magic.ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—

Youâ€™ve shown me what it means to be loved with patience, understanding, and warmth. Youâ€™ve listened to me when I needed to vent, lifted me when I was down, and stayed even though I still some flaws in me. That kind of love? Itâ€™s rare. And itâ€™s something Iâ€™ll never take for granted.ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—

I look at you and I see my future. I see the person I want to grow with, learn with, make memories with. I see the one I want beside me on both the brightest and darkest days. I want to be your forever, your permanent person just like you've become mine.ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—

Happy 2nd months of love to us, my love. I hope this little surprise reminds you how much you mean to me. I may not always find the perfect words, but please know that every heartbeat, every thought, every part of me is yours.ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—

Forever and always,ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—
Your love, your safe place, your biggest fan.ğŸ’—ğŸ’—ğŸ’—
